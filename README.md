Flitter: Flat twitter client
=======

Fork of the proprietary twitter client MetroTwit Loop.

What's done: 
1. Full functionality of MetroTwit is kept.
2. MetroTwit Plus (Multi-account support and ads disabling) is enabled for default.
3. Little themes tidy up (Now only Dark theme supported, don't try to select Light theme)

TODO:
1. Complete the interface cleanup
2. Start a code cleanup (GOTOs and other compiler-generated shit)
3. Fix support for custom API tokens (Works now but requires to set specific settings to a custom twitter application)
4. Impliment autoupdate
